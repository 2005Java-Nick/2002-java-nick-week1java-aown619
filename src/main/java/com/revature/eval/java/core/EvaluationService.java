	 * the position of a specified input value (the search "key") within an array
	 * sorted by key value.

	 * element or, if the search key is greater, on the sub-array to the right.
	 * 
	 * If the remaining array to be searched is empty, then the key cannot be found
	 * in the array and a special "not found" indication is returned.
	 * 
	 * A binary search halves the number of items to check with each iteration, so
	 * locating an item (or determining its absence) takes logarithmic time. A
